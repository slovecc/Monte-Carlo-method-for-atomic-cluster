# Monte-Carlo-method-for-atomic-cluster

This code was developed for a project linked to the atomic simulation of a system composed of Ar and Xe.

It is based on Monte Carlo simulation and computing the Temperature and Energy of the system, it is obtained
the final stable configuration.

By changing the parameter of Lennard-Jones potential and of the system, different final clustering can be obtained.

The program is written in C:
to compile:
gcc -lm -o LJ_Ar-Xe LJ_Ar-Xe.c ran2.c
